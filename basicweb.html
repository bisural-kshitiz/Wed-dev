            <h2>More About the project</h2>
            <p>
                Firstly, I checked up through the w3school and the refrence was given from the xamk learn. Then I applied it through the vs code studio 
            and the project was created. The project is based on the basic web development which includes the HTML and CSS.
            The project is a simple website which contains the information about me and my work. It is not completely responive
             but I will be working on it and making it completely responive in all device category.</p>
             <p>
                Then, I did little bit of coding for it using html structure and the containers to adjust the size and shape of the images.
                The css was used for it.Then step by step I checked up and the project was ready to submit. Because this is a small project
                 I dont have a detailed descrption on it.</p>
             <p>I uploaded it to the github.</p>
